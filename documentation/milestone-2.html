            <h3>Content Strategy</h3>
            <div class="info-2">
                <p>My site will be one page, and it will consist of the following sections:</p>
                <p><strong>Title Page:</strong> This is a clear beige background with a large font Title text of my name. Below the main Title will be a subtitle telling the visitor my ambition, which is to be a professional web developer.</p>
                <p><strong>About Me:</strong> A brief introduction on myself. My interests in activities and studies. I will place a graph to depict the amount of time I spend on each thing I enjoy doing. The single image carousel will show pictures of me doing the things I like e.g. eating out with friends, hanging out with family on vacation, Tacos, and playing games with friends. I will also detail my experience with programming languages and web development. The background will be a neutral tan with the nav bar a darker brown.</p>
                <p><strong>My Accomplishments:</strong> There will be two sections within this section. One section will have a backdrop in cream with the listing of my awarded degrees and education awards. I was awarded with the title of 'Crimson Scholar' during my time at Community College and University. There were also the times when I was named to the Dean's list for academic excellence. The second section, which also has a backdrop of cream, will list my professional certifications and academic club memberships. The certifications will include my certification in Linux Administration and AWS Development. The education based clubs I was involved with will include my membership in the 'Debug Club' at the local community college and my current ongoing membership in 'The National Society of Leadership and Success'. If needed, I will place a filler image or images in the middle of the subsections to be a creative divider. I may also just place a regular vertical line as the divider.</p>
                <p><strong>My Projects:</strong> This section is where I will showcase the projects I made with Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The projects are a collection that were completed during my time in College and on my personal time. There will be a picture gallery with the pictures of the gameplay from my Python game and the web application that was made during my time at the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. There are also smaller projects that I completed while I was working at Electronic Caregiver. The smaller Javascript projects are worth talking about and displaying on the page because they gave me a better understanding of the JavaScript Language. I will go into a brief but detailed explanation of the process and steps, and the time and effort it took to complete. If I need to display more pictures, I will make each photo a single image carousel or a pop-up gallery. I will list the technology and programming languages used as icons near each project picture.</p>
                <p><strong>Contact Me:</strong> Here will be a form with name and email text input boxes. Below those boxes will be the text area box where the user can type a message for me to read. There will be an explanation on why I want the site visitor to message me. The main reason to receive messages is to have job recruiters or employers contact me for an interview. I will specify that I want to be reached for job and collaboration opportunities. I will have a professional picture of me in this section so the site visitor will see that I am serious about professionalism. There will be more text filler if needed to complete the section.</p>
