                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project is to be used as a professional development tool. I will showcase my achievements in school and personal projects. There will also be a list of professional certificates and educational awards. Having the educational. professional, and personal achievements listed will attract the employers in Tech and IT.</p>
                <p><strong>Audience:</strong> The site has the intention of attracting professionals within the IT industry. The target individual is a person who is looking to hire for a position within the company. Moreover, I will be happy to attract other developers who are working on projects and are looking for a collaborative partner to contribute to a project. Target audience to include: peers, collaborators, hiring managers, and recruiters.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The primary goal of the site will be to have employers or recruiters get in contact with me for the purpose of recruitment and job placement. A secondary purpose is to have other developers reach out to me to comment on my achievements and education. I will gladly accept an invitation to collaborate on a project, if presented with such an opportunity. The website will be an excellent addition to my professional portfolio and I will present it to anyone that wants to know more about my professional and educational work/accomplishments.</p>

                <p><strong>Name:</strong>Sherri B Martin</p>
                <p><strong>Age:</strong>34</p>
                <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Co-founder and CTO at CreativeFoodCreations.com, a startup that is like Fudrucker's in allowing you to build a burger and have the creation made by a chef and the recipe sent, along with the sandwich, to your residence. The company will continue to send you the recipe with ingredients at a monthly rate. The company also allows for building of snacks such as, cookies, donuts, chips, sodas, and cereal to name a few. The company relies heavily on an online presence made possible by websites and social media. The company posts publications to inform people that they are hiring for in-house full-stack developers. Sherri has contracted with restaurants to help them find creative creations with food and have the food creations be tested on the public to see if they will add the item onto their menu and attract other interested individuals or restaurants to the CreativeFoodCreations site to create creative burger and cookie designs. The website is a collaboration tool in terms of creating food designs and rating and commenting on them.</p>
                <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Mac power user. Uses a macbook pro with Apple M4 chip technology. 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, with 24GB memory and 1TB of storage space. iPhone 15 Pro.</p>
                <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> does work as a video editor and graphic design as part of her business management activities. Sherri was a graphic designer and videographer in previous jobs in marketing. Sherri is a people person and enjoys spending time with potential investors and relaying messages to her employees. She does not have much time to spend looking at applicants' portfolio sites and will skim through resumes 30 seconds at a time. Her company has become a desirable place for Tech students and graduates to work at. She does not hold people's resume or experience as impressive and rather looks for the ability to create outstanding website content. Sherri has a strong social media presence and attends tech and restaurant community networking events. She has found her employees through events, LinkedIn, and X.</p>
                <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Sherri needs to hire more web developers to allow for her growing company to place more customization controls on the company website because the company is branching their food creations to Cereals, granola, and trail mixes. Sherri is looking to hire 3 new web devs to update and maintain the website. She prefers hiring someone with 2 years experience, but will consider candidates that have a decent project portfolio. She is frustrated because she has felt that two of the three new hires must be hired within 2 weeks. She has been flooded with applicants but is having a hard time finding the person with the correct amount of experience or with an impressive portfolio. The interviews are ongoing, but she has not heard of candidates that hold the personality and dedication that is needed to push the company forward onto future success.</p>
                <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Sherri is focused on filling the role of the web developer to allow for the website to be customized to the specific details that have been laid out by the UI/UX team. The most important thing for the company is to have employees that can maintain company culture and morale. Can Sherri find a placement for a candidate by screening the candidate, over the phone, for 3 minutes max? The time for interviews are extremely limited and must be saved for those who are very much like the desired ideal employee. Can she find the candidate by taking quick glaces through the applicants' personal sites? The job market is very competitive, so there are many candidates that must be screened.</p>
                <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I need to quickly find if the candidate holds the necessary traits that will warrant him or her a phone call. There isn't much time to fully ensure the competence of a fully capable web developer by looking at websites, so a coding challenge may also be necessary as a final step.</p>
